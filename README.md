# Solid Cache

**Upgrading from v0.3.0 or earlier? Please see [upgrading to version v0.4.x and beyond](upgrading_to_version_0.4.x.md)**

Solid Cache is a database-backed Active Support cache store implementation.

Using SQL databases backed by SSDs we can have caches that are much larger and cheaper than traditional memory-only Redis or Memcached backed caches.

## Introduction

Solid Cache is a FIFO (first in, first out) cache. While this is not as efficient as an LRU cache, it is mitigated by the longer cache lifespan.

A FIFO cache is much easier to manage:
1. We don't need to track when items are read.
2. We can estimate and control the cache size by comparing the maximum and minimum IDs.
3. By deleting from one end of the table and adding at the other end we can avoid fragmentation (on MySQL at least).

## Installation
Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "solid_cache"
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install solid_cache
```

#### Cache database configuration

The default installation of Solid Cache expects a database named `cache` in `database.yml`. It should
have it's own connection pool to avoid mixing cache queries in other transactions.

You can use the primary database for your cache like this:

```yaml
# config/database.yml
production:
  primary: &production_primary
    ...
  cache:
    <<: *production_primary
```

Or a separate database like this:

```yaml
production:
  primary:
    ...
  cache:
    database: cache_development
    host: 127.0.0.1
    migrations_paths: "db/cache/migrate"
```

#### Install Solid Cache

Now, you need to install the necessary migrations and configure the cache store. You can do both at once using the provided generator:

```bash
# If using the primary database
$ bin/rails generate solid_cache:install

# Or if using a dedicated database
$ DATABASE=cache bin/rails generate solid_cache:install
```

This will set solid_cache as the cache store in production, and will copy the optional configuration file and the required migration over to your app.

Alternatively, you can add only the migration to your app:

```bash
# If using the primary database
$ bin/rails generate solid_cache:install:migrations

# Or if using a dedicated database
$ DATABASE=cache bin/rails generate solid_cache:install:migrations
```

And set Solid Cache as your application's cache store backend manually, in your environment config:

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb
config.cache_store = :solid_cache_store
```

#### Run migrations

Finally, you need to run the migrations:

```bash
$ bin/rails db:migrate
```

### Configuration

Configuration will be read from `config/solid_cache.yml`. You can change the location of the config file by setting the `SOLID_CACHE_CONFIG` env variable.

The format of the file is:

```yml
default:
  store_options: &default_store_options
    max_age: <%= 60.days.to_i %>
    namespace: <%= Rails.env %>
  size_estimate_samples: 1000

development: &development
  database: development_cache
  store_options:
    <<: *default_store_options
    max_size: <%= 256.gigabytes %>

production: &production
  databases: [production_cache1, production_cache2]
  store_options:
    <<: *default_store_options
    max_entries: <%= 256.gigabytes %>
```

For the full list of keys for `store_options` see [Cache configuration](#cache-configuration). Any options passed to the cache lookup will overwrite those specified here.

#### Connection configuration

You can set one of `database`, `databases` and `connects_to` in the config file. They will be used to configure the cache databases in `SolidCache::Record#connects_to`.

Setting `database` to `cache_db` will configure with:

```ruby
SolidCache::Record.connects_to database: { writing: :cache_db }
```

Setting `databases` to `[cache_db, cache_db2]` is the equivalent of:

```ruby
SolidCache::Record.connects_to shards: { cache_db1: { writing: :cache_db1 },  cache_db2: { writing: :cache_db2 } }
```

If `connects_to` is set, it will be passed directly.

If none of these are set, Solid Cache will use the `ActiveRecord::Base` connection pool. This means that cache reads and writes will be part of any wrapping
database transaction.

#### Engine configuration

There are three options that can be set on the engine:

- `executor` - the [Rails executor](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/threading_and_code_execution.html#executor) used to wrap asynchronous operations, defaults to the app executor
- `connects_to` - a custom connects to value for the abstract `SolidCache::Record` active record model. Required for sharding and/or using a separate cache database to the main app. This will overwrite any value set in `config/solid_cache.yml`
- `size_estimate_samples` - if `max_size` is set on the cache, the number of the samples used to estimate the size.
- `encrypted` - whether cache values should be encrypted (see [Enabling encryption](#enabling-encryption))
- `encryption_context_properties` - custom encryption context properties

These can be set in your Rails configuration:

```ruby
Rails.application.configure do
  config.solid_cache.size_estimate_samples = 1000
end
```

#### Cache configuration

Solid Cache supports these options in addition to the standard `ActiveSupport::Cache::Store` options:

- `error_handler` - a Proc to call to handle any transient database errors that are raised (default: log errors as warnings)
- `expiry_batch_size` - the batch size to use when deleting old records (default: `100`)
- `expiry_method` - what expiry method to use `thread` or `job` (default: `thread`)
- `expiry_queue` - which queue to add expiry jobs to (default: `default`)
- `max_age` - the maximum age of entries in the cache (default: `2.weeks.to_i`). Can be set to `nil`, but this is not recommended unless using `max_entries` to limit the size of the cache.
- `max_entries` - the maximum number of entries allowed in the cache (default: `nil`, meaning no limit)
- `max_size` - the maximum size of the cache entries (default `nil`, meaning no limit)
- `cluster` - (deprecated) a Hash of options for the cache database cluster, e.g `{ shards: [:database1, :database2, :database3] }`
- `clusters` - (deprecated) an Array of Hashes for multiple cache clusters (ignored if `:cluster` is set)
- `shards` - an Array of databases
- `active_record_instrumentation` - whether to instrument the cache's queries (default: `true`)
- `clear_with` - clear the cache with `:truncate` or `:delete` (default `truncate`, except for when `Rails.env.test?` then `delete`)
- `max_key_bytesize` - the maximum size of a normalized key in bytes (default `1024`)

For more information on cache clusters, see [Sharding the cache](#sharding-the-cache)

### Cache expiry

Solid Cache tracks writes to the cache. For every write it increments a counter by 1. Once the counter reaches 50% of the `expiry_batch_size` it adds a task to run on a background thread. That task will:

1. Check if we have exceeded the `max_entries` or `max_size` values (if set).
   The current entries are estimated by subtracting the max and min IDs from the `SolidCache::Entry` table.
   The current size is estimated by sampling the entry `byte_size` columns.
2. If we have, it will delete `expiry_batch_size` entries.
3. If not, it will delete up to `expiry_batch_size` entries, provided they are all older than `max_age`.

Expiring when we reach 50% of the batch size allows us to expire records from the cache faster than we write to it when we need to reduce the cache size.

Only triggering expiry when we write means that if the cache is idle, the background thread is also idle.

If you want the cache expiry to be run in a background job instead of a thread, you can set `expiry_method` to `:job`. This will enqueue a `SolidCache::ExpiryJob`.

### Sharding the cache

Solid Cache uses the [Maglev](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/44824.pdf) consistent hashing scheme to shard the cache across multiple databases.

To shard:

1. Add the configuration for the database shards to database.yml.
2. Configure the shards via `config.solid_cache.connects_to`.
3. Pass the shards for the cache to use via the cluster option.

For example:
```yml
# config/database.yml
production:
  cache_shard1:
    database: cache1_production
    host: cache1-db
  cache_shard2:
    database: cache2_production
    host: cache2-db
  cache_shard3:
    database: cache3_production
    host: cache3-db
```

```yaml
# config/solid_cache.yml
production:
  databases: [cache_shard1, cache_shard2, cache_shard3]
```

### Enabling encryption

To encrypt the cache values, you can add set the encrypt property.

```yaml
# config/solid_cache.yml
production:
  encrypt: true
```
or
```ruby
# application.rb
config.solid_cache.encrypt = true
```

You will need to set up your application to (use Active Record Encryption)[https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_encryption.html].

Solid Cache by default uses a custom encryptor and message serializer that are optimised for it.

Firstly it disabled compression with the encryptor `ActiveRecord::Encryption::Encryptor.new(compress: false)` - the cache already compresses the data.
Secondly it uses `ActiveRecord::Encryption::MessagePackMessageSerializer.new` as the serializer. This serializer can only be used for binary columns,
but can store about 40% more data than the standard serializer.

You can choose your own context properties instead if you prefer:

```ruby
# application.rb
config.solid_cache.encryption_context_properties = {
  encryptor: ActiveRecord::Encryption::Encryptor.new,
  message_serializer: ActiveRecord::Encryption::MessageSerializer.new
}
```

**Note**

Encryption currently does not work for PostgreSQL, as Rails does not yet support encrypting binary columns for it.
See https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52650.

### Index size limits
The Solid Cache migrations try to create an index with 1024 byte entries. If that is too big for your database, you should:

1. Edit the index size in the migration.
2. Set `max_key_bytesize` on your cache to the new value.

## Development

Run the tests with `bin/rake test`. By default, these will run against SQLite.

You can also run the tests against MySQL and PostgreSQL. First start up the databases:

```shell
$ docker compose up -d
```

Next, setup the database schema:

```shell
$ TARGET_DB=mysql bin/rails db:setup
$ TARGET_DB=postgres bin/rails db:setup
```


Then run the tests for the target database:

```shell
$ TARGET_DB=mysql bin/rake test
$ TARGET_DB=postgres bin/rake test
```

### Testing with multiple Rails versions

Solid Cache relies on [appraisal](https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal/tree/main) to test
multiple Rails versions.

To run a test for a specific version run:

```shell
bundle exec appraisal rails-7-1 bin/rake test
```

After updating the dependencies in the `Gemfile` please run:

```shell
$ bundle
$ appraisal update
```

This ensures that all the Rails versions dependencies are updated.
